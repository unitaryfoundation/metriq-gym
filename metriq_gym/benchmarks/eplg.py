"""
EPLG benchmark implementation for Metriq‑Gym.

This benchmark uses the Layer Fidelity protocol from Qiskit Experiments to
estimate the error per layered two‑qubit gate (EPLG) on a chain of qubits.
The algorithm creates two disjoint layers of two‑qubit gates along a user
specified list of physical qubits, generates randomized benchmarking circuits
of varying lengths and samples, executes them on the provided quantum device,
and analyses the resulting data to extract the EPLG.  The final figure of
merit reported to the command line interface is the EPLG associated with the
longest chain length specified in the input configuration.  For convenience
the full analysis results are also returned as a pandas DataFrame so that
users can reproduce the Layer Fidelity and related plots on their own.

The benchmark accepts the following parameters (specified in the schema
``eplg.schema.json``):

``qubit_num`` (required): Positive integer specifying the number of qubits
    in the chain on which to run the layered fidelity experiment. A connected
    chain of this length is selected at runtime from the backend coupling map,
    and two disjoint layers of two‑qubit gates are constructed along it.

``lengths`` (required): A list of positive integers specifying the sequence
    lengths (i.e. the number of layers) at which to sample the randomized
    benchmarking circuits.  Larger values correspond to longer circuits and
    provide a better estimate of the asymptotic error rate.

``num_samples`` (required): The number of random circuits to sample for each
    element of ``lengths``.

``nshots`` (required): The number of measurement shots to use when executing
    the circuits on the backend.  A larger number of shots reduces the
    statistical uncertainty in the estimation of fidelities.

``seed`` (optional): An integer seed to initialize the pseudo‑random number
    generator used when generating the randomized benchmarking circuits.  If
    omitted, the generator is seeded randomly.

``two_qubit_gate`` (optional): A string identifying which two‑qubit gate to
    use when constructing the circuit layers.  If omitted, Qiskit will
    select a suitable native gate supported by the target backend.

``one_qubit_basis_gates`` (optional): A list of one‑qubit gate names used to
    synthesize 1‑qubit Cliffords.  If omitted, Qiskit will default to the
    basis gates supported by the backend.

The benchmark returns a single floating point number representing the error
per layered gate at the largest sequence length provided, along with a
pandas DataFrame summarizing intermediate metrics.  This DataFrame contains
rows for chain‑level metrics (layer fidelity and EPLG) as well as
approximate process fidelities for each 1‑qubit and 2‑qubit subsystem of
the selected chain.  Including these additional metrics enables users to
reproduce plots similar to those shown in the accompanying notebook,
highlighting 1Q/2Q process fidelities and their contributions to the chain
fidelity.
