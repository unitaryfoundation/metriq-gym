metriq-gym is a Python framework for implementing and running standard quantum benchmarks on different quantum devices by different providers.

- _Open_ – Open-source since its inception and fully developed in public.
- _Transparent_ – All benchmark parameters are defined in a schema file and the benchmark code is reviewable by the community.
- _Cross-platform_ – Supports running benchmarks on multiple quantum hardware providers (_integration powered by [qBraid-SDK](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid)_)
- _User-friendly_ – Provides a simple command-line interface for dispatching, monitoring, and polling benchmark jobs (you can go on with your life while your job waits in the queue).

## Quick Start

Four easy steps to get started with `metriq-gym`!

1. Install `metriq-gym` directly in your Python environment using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install metriq-gym
   ```

2. Download a benchmark configuration file from the `schemas/examples/` directory (this example uses the WIT — Wormhole-inspired teleportation — benchmark)

    ```sh
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unitaryfoundation/metriq-gym/refs/heads/main/metriq_gym/schemas/examples/wit.example.json
    ```

3. Dispatch it to a quantum device or simulator.

    ```sh
    mgym job dispatch wit.example.json -p local -d aer_simulator
    ```
4. Poll the job to get the results.

    ```sh
    mgym job poll latest
    ```

You will see the results of the benchmark printed in your terminal. E.g.
```sh
{'device': 'aer_simulator',
 'job_type': 'WIT',
 'provider': 'local',
 'results': {'expectation_value': 0.99658203125},
 'timestamp': '2025-07-29T20:31:17.978851',
 'version': '0.1.3.dev0'}
```
